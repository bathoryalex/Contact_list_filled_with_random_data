# Contact_list_filled_with_random_data

1. Create a web based contact list which can show multiple contacts' info in one page. Every contact has the following properties:
    - FirstName,
    - LastName,
    - City,
    - Address,
    - Email,
    - Phone.
2. Every contact item should appear in a business card format.
3. To generate random test data use the public API described below.
4. Create a new object in your javascript file named Contact which can store all the data of a particular contact so you can parse the      JSON data into this.
5. Use XMLHttpRequest to get the data from the API.
